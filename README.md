# DataScience_PyGWalker
PyGWalker (Python binding of Graphic Walker) is a Python library that helps you turn your pandas DataFrame into a highly interactive Tableau-style visualization tool. It combines the power of pandas, Jupyter Notebook, and an intuitive drag-and-drop GUI to make exploratory data analysis (EDA) fast and easy â€” without switching to external BI tools.
